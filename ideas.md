Things to consider
------------------

  * Multiple languages working together
    * Teamwork, working after-YRS
    * Utilising our own specialities
  * Ways we could extend (see docs/extensions.md)


Intro
-----

  * A really easy intro piece to do is to show up the first slide of the
    presentation saying "Obama Speech Generator" and read out a pre-generated
    speech or generate one right in front of the judges (depending on how good
    it's working).
